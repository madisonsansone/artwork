# artwork

A selection of artwork and photos I’ve created for school and for fun!
This folder contains example photographs of three creative mediums from other disciplines: **painting, drawing, and photography**. All works were designed and created by **Madison Sansone**.

## Painting
The painting works were completed as part of **FA 11B: Beginning Painting — Visual Possibilities**, taught by **Ariel Freiberg**.

## Drawing
The drawing works were completed in **FA 3A: Introduction to Drawing I**, taught by **Alfredo Gisholt**.

## Photography
In my free time, I enjoy taking photographs using both **film and digital cameras**. I use photography as an additional medium to explore and express my creativity beyond formal coursework.

These works reflect my interest in visual thinking, composition, and creative expression across multiple disciplines.
